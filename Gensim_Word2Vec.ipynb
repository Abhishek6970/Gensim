Introduction\\nFeed systems are used to position the machine tool components carrying the cutting tool and\\nworkpiece to the desired location [ 1]. They are one of the most important subsystems of computer\\nnumerical controlled (CNC) machine tools, as their positioning accuracy and speed determine the\\nquality and productivity of machine tools [ 2]. Feed drive systems are either powered by linear motors\\ndirectly, or by rotary motors via a ball screw and nut. Among them, ball screw feed drive systems are\\nwidely used in CNC machine tools for their high sti \\x0bness, reliable operation and ability to mitigate\\nthe impact of inertial and cutting force variations [ 3,4]. Machining accuracy signiﬁcantly depends on\\nthe tracking performance of the feed systems for a given trajectory. Therefore, the ball screw should\\nexhibit good transient and steady tracking performance to meet the demands of high productivity and\\nhigh precision of machine tools [5,6].\\nTo improve the tracking accuracy of the ball screw feed system, position error compensation\\ncontrol is commonly used. If the tracking error can be estimated accurately in advance, the control\\nproblem of the feed system can be eased. Therefore, a model of the ball screw feed system that can\\naccurately predicted tracking error is essential to improve tracking performance. There are many factors\\na\\x0becting the tracking performance of the feed system, such as nonlinear friction, backlash, vibration,\\nSymmetry 2019 ,11, 1156; doi:10.3390 /sym11091156 www.mdpi.com /journal /symmetry', 'Symmetry 2019 ,11, 1156 2 of 20\\nelastic deformation, thermal deformation and so on. These factors have attracted much attention\\nand extensive research, and numerous papers have been published. Various friction models were\\nresearched in [ 7–11], such as stick-slip, static friction, Stribeck e \\x0bects, and so on. Three kinds of backlash\\nmodels, which are the hysteresis model [ 12], dead zone model [ 13] and vibration-impact model [ 14],\\ncan be found in previous studies. Another issue is the vibration; vibrations caused by the resonance of\\nthe feed drive were discussed and suppressed by using either the simpliﬁed model [ 15] or the complex\\nmodel [ 16]. Some other studies have concentrated on the elastic deformation [ 17,18] and thermal\\ndeformation [ 19] of the ball screw feed systems. Most studies have used lumped-parameters models to\\nanalyze the ball screw feed systems. In order to overcome the shortcomings of lumped-parameters\\nmodels, the investigation of hybrid, distributed-lumped parameter modeling methods for ball screw\\nfeed drive systems was conducted in earlier studies [ 20–22]. Besides, the ﬁnite element method (FEM)\\nis also a common approach to model the ball-screw system. In [ 23], the FEM model was integrated\\nwith the servo dynamics to evaluate the dynamics response of the transmission system. The studies\\nmentioned above have made signiﬁcant contributions to improving the performance of the ball screw\\nfeed systems, but the theoretical analysis of the dynamic tracking performance of ball screw is very\\ncomplicated; the inﬂuencing factors are so many so that it is di \\x0ecult to further improve the prediction\\naccuracy of tracking error based on theoretical analysis. What’s more, most studies have mainly\\nconcentrated on the modeling of the mechanical part, the coupling e \\x0bects between di \\x0berent domains\\nhave not been considered.\\nThe feed systems consist of multi-domain subsystems such as the mechanical transmission\\nsubsystem, electrical subsystem, control subsystem, and so on. These subsystems belong to di \\x0berent\\ndisciplines and there are complex coupling relationship among them. The performance of the feed\\nsystem depends not only on the performance of the subsystems in each domain, but also on the\\ninteraction between them. In fact, the tracking errors of the ball screw feed system are mainly composed\\nof two parts: the error caused by the servo control subsystem and the error caused by the mechanical\\nsubsystem. Therefore, a multi-domain integrated system model is essential to accurately predict the\\ntracking performance. Research on multi-domain integrated modeling of ball screw feed systems has\\nbeen rare so far. Some integrated modeling methods for feed systems in machine tools have been\\nproposed [ 24–28]. In the references, the multi-domain coupling characteristics of a feed system were\\ntaken into account, but the modeling e \\x0eciency was low and it was hard to achieve real seamless\\nintegration due to use of the modeling method based on signal ﬂow. Some attempts have been made\\nto use the non-causal modeling method based on Modelica to establish the model of feed system,\\nbut the model was not strictly in accordance with the actual system and the model was not validated by\\nexperiment [ 29–31]. The deﬁciencies of existing research into integrated modeling of a feed system are\\nthat the parameters of the integrated model are too many, so they are di \\x0ecult to determine accurately,\\nmeaning the accuracy of the model is limited.\\nAccording to previous research, the feed system model is usually derived from expert domain\\nknowledge (e.g., basic physical principles). This modeling approach is called analytical modeling,\\nalso known as knowledge-driven, physics-based, or mechanism modeling. However, for complicated\\nmulti-domain systems such as feed systems, it is often too complex to derive their analytical model\\nand to fully capture their dynamics. Additionally, the parameters may be time-varying or unknown,\\nwhich limit the feed system’s modeling accuracy. The feed system model can also be established by\\nmachine learning techniques, which is called the data-driven modeling method. Machine learning is\\none of today’s most rapidly growing technical ﬁelds [ 32]; there has been growing interest in applying\\nmachine learning to draw insights gained from the data in engineering [ 33]. Data-driven analytics\\ntechniques have been applied for prediction [ 34–37], detection and classiﬁcation [ 38,39], forecasting [ 40],\\ncontrol [ 41,42], and many problems of speciﬁc interest. For example, Zhe Li et al. [ 34] proposed a\\ndata-driven method for backlash error predication through the deep belief network (DBN). John C.\\nZiegert et al. [ 37] used an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) to predict tool point positioning error in\\nmachine tools. Ronay Ak et al. [ 38] proposed a prediction model based on a neural network for', 'Symmetry 2019 ,11, 1156 3 of 20\\nestimating the energy consumption of a milling machine, while Gaussian process (GP) has been\\nused to develop the data-driven energy prediction model with uncertainty for a milling machine [ 36].\\nJinkyoo Park et al.

The Learned Data-Driven Model\\nThe accuracy of the analytical model can hardly reach a high level because the model can hardly\\ncapture all aspects of the feed system’s intrinsic properties, and there remain unmodeled dynamics.\\nTherefore, a data-driven model was developed as a supplement to the analytical model.\\nIn this thesis, the data-driven model was used to ﬁt the deviation between the output of the\\nanalytical model and the measured value. A back propagation neural network (BPNN) was chosen to\\nbuild the data-driven model because the data-driven model is small in scale and the BPNN structure\\nis simple, the local extremum points are few, the ﬁtting accuracy is high, and it is easy to transplant.\\nThe structure of BPNNs can be divided into input layer, hidden layer and output layer. In the hybrid\\nmodel, the data-driven model was used to predict the deviation between theoretical model output\\nand measured value. The scale of the data-driven model was relatively small, so a three-layer BPNN\\nwas chosen in which the position command signal and the working table displacement output from\\nanalytical model were the input layer neurons. There was only one output neuron which was the\\ndeviation between the working table displacement measured by experiment and that simulated by the\\nanalytical model. The relevant theory of BPNN can be referred to [ 47]. Combining with the empirical\\nformula, the number of neurons in the hidden layer was determined by the trial and error method.\\nThe number of neurons in the hidden layer is 10 and the empirical formula is shown as follows\\nl<p\\nm+n+a (21)\\nIn Equation (21), m,nand lare the number of nodes in the input layer, output layer and hidden\\nlayer respectively, and ais a constant between 0 and 10.\\nBP neural network represents the mapping relationship between nindependent variables and\\nmdependent variables.
